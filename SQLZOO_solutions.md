## SELECT basics
Some simple queries to get you started

1.
```sql
  SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name = 'Germany'
```
2.
```sql
  SELECT name, gdp/population FROM world
    WHERE area > 5000000
```
3.
```sql
  SELECT name, population FROM world
    WHERE name IN ('Ireland','Iceland','Denmark');
```
4.
```sql
  SELECT name, area FROM world
    WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
```
## SELECT from WORLD
1.
```sql
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
```
2.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population>200000000
```
3.
```sql
SELECT name, gdp/population FROM world
  WHERE population > 200000000
```
4.
```sql
SELECT name, population/1000000 FROM world
  WHERE continent = 'South America'
```
5.
```sql
SELECT name,population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('France','Germany','Italy')
```
6.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%United%'
```
7.
```sql
select name, population, area from world
  where population > 250000000 or area > 3000000
```
8.
```sql
select name, population, area from world
  where population > 250000000 xor area > 3000000
```
9.
```sql
select name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2) from world
  where continent = 'South America'
```
10.
```sql
select name, ROUND(gdp/population,-3) from world

```
### Harder Questions:
11.

       CASE WHEN continent='Oceania' THEN 'Australasia'
            ELSE continent END
  FROM world
 WHERE name LIKE 'N%'

12.
```sql
SELECT name,
       CASE WHEN continent='Europe' or continent='Asia' THEN 'Eurasia'

            ELSE continent END
  FROM world
 WHERE name LIKE 'A%' or name LIKE 'B%'
```
13.(this one was a doozy)

```sql
SELECT name, continent, CASE
                     WHEN continent = 'Oceania' THEN 'Australasia'
                     WHEN continent = 'Eurasia' THEN 'Europe/Asia'
                     WHEN name = 'Turkey' THEN 'Europe/Asia'
    WHEN continent = 'Caribbean' AND name LIKE 'B%' then 'North America'

                 ELSE continent END
FROM world ORDER BY name
```

## SELECT from NOBEL
1.

```
6.
```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world
                   WHERE gdp > 0 AND continent = 'Europe')
```
7.
```sql
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)
```
8.
```sql
SELECT continent, name FROM world x
  WHERE name <= ALL
    (SELECT name FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent)
--Got this one to work.. but I'm still not quite sure what the variables are doing.
